# DistanceEst
1. Get multiple locations and estimate the distance so that one can pick the locations to consider with some guidance from script
2. One address is fixed and distance is computed for other addresses to the fixed location.
3. (currently does not consider road network, direct distance might not reflect actual driving/travel distance)

Todo:
  1. Find path to multiple locations? to sort the order visit?
